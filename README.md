# ML-property-appraisal

## Description
We built Machine Learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees Classifier Models to determine an approximate predicted valuation of a property using various metrics such as number of rooms, land size, housing type, etc. The main goal is to build a more consistent and precise solution to property appraisal.
